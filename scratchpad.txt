how do I want to update the data
    - one way is to update or insert the data everytime new data arrives
    - second way is to manually diff for new data
    - third way is to let room handle this for us
        - this is good; will see if room have something like this; so update operations are faster
        - I think room automatically diff

updatedView/Bookmarked Fragment will only show libraries which are bookmarked and latestVersion > oldVersion

DONE => Feature 0: run work whenever user opens the app.
    - should consider the case when user opens it multiple times in a day.
        - in that case we should only fetch it one time; on first opening
    - user can force fetch though (refresh)

Feature 1: Ability to Bookmark Libraries <== here
    - only show diff between bookmarked libraries
    - auto fetch and showNotifications can be enabled
        - will show notification if bookmarked library changes (nope)

Feature 2: user should have ability to enable fetching in background
    - in that case we gonna fetch every 12 hours
    - i.e. giving work manager interval of 12 hours

Feature 3:
    - sort by date option in main screen
    - able to search
    - update date for a library is same as last modified header date in response of group-index

Comparing Versions of Artifacts
    - Will enable us implement feature 1

Currently, trying to find if i should use bottom navigation or viewpager
    - going with viewpager
========================================================================
UI Enhancements (After Implementing all of the above functionality)
 - swipe to refresh

Error Handling:
    - currently it only presents a snackbar saying update failed with retry button
    - Show error(snackbar saying no network) on app opening if network is not available
    - error when parsing goes wrong or fetching goes wrong

NOTES

just in case, vo stands for value object / value type

    - The reason he's saying we do not need Dispatchers.IO

    - * Room will provide main-safety automatically if you use suspend functions, RxJava, or LiveData.
      ** Networking libraries such as Retrofit and Volley manage their own threads
       and do not require explicit main-safety in your code when used with Kotlin coroutines.
