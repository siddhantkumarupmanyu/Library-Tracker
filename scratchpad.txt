======================================================

we will only track latest stable release and latest version, not all releases

library should contain artifacts and not vice versa
    - Instead of saying library parser we can say package parser

Feature 0: run work when ever user opens the app.
    - should consider the case when user opens it multiple times in a day.
        - in that case we should only fetch it one time; on first opening
        - Feature 4, user can force fetch though

Feature 1: Able to notify if new versions of bookmarked artifacts are available
Feature 2: Able to diff between last fetch and new fetch
    - this feature restricts us to only fetch when user reopens the app
    - and not in the background
Feature 3: What is I just combine feature 1 & 2
    - we will only give diff between the bookmarked libraries

Comparing Versions of Artifacts
    - Will enable us implement feature 3


Feature 4: ability to force fetch

Errors:
    - Show error on app opening if network is not available
    - error when something parsing goes wrong or fetching goes wrong
